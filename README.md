Exdata-plotting2

THis is an example of plotting the course data using excel.  Some caveats:
I used 64 bit excel 2013.
I used the PowerQuery Addin for Excel
With PowerQuery, the steps to load/combine the data are imbedded in the queries

I don't claim that these charts are correct - just what I came up with!
